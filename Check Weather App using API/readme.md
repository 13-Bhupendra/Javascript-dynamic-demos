## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a city name into the search bar.
2. On clicking the **Search** button, the app calls the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
3. If a valid city is found:
   - Temperature appears at the center.
   - Humidity and wind speed show below with relevant icons.
4. If the input is blank or invalid, an alert is shown.
5. Everything updates **without page reload** and in **real-time**.
