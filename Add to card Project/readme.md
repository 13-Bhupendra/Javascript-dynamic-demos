# 🛒 Add to Cart - Simple Shopping Cart Web App

## 📄 Overview
The **Add to Cart** project is a lightweight and responsive shopping cart system built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It dynamically displays a list of products (e.g., watches), allows users to add items to a cart, and calculates the total price in real-time.

This project demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation, basic cart logic, and clean UI/UX design — all without using any external libraries!
