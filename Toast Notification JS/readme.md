## 📄 Overview
This project is a modern **toast notification system** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It provides users with quick, temporary messages for actions such as success, errors, and invalid inputs. The notifications are sleek, animated, and disappear automatically after a few seconds, enhancing the overall user experience.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The webpage contains **three buttons** – *Success*, *Error*, and *Invalid*.
2. On clicking any button, the JavaScript function `showNotification()` is triggered.
3. The function dynamically creates a `<div>` with the selected message and appends it to the toast container.
4. A **colored bottom bar** (green, red, or orange) appears inside the toast, representing the type of message.
5. After 5 seconds, the toast fades out and is removed from the DOM.
